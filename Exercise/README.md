# Excercise

Exercises that can be used to practice, the resolutions within the files can be read after completion or in times of not knowing how to resolve.

These are the ways I found to complete the exercises, there may be better ways to reach the same results.

---
```
1 - Make an algorithm that receives a number and shows a message if that number is greater than 10.
```
```
2 - Make an algorithm that receives two numbers and shows in ascending order.
```
```
3 - Make an algorithm that asks for a number and shows if the number is pair or inpair.
```
```
4 - Create a program that receives a number and inform if it is a multiple of 10.
```
```
5 - make an algorithm that receives two numbers and shows in ascending order, or shows a message if they are equal.
```
```
6 - Write a program that asks for an integer. Display an error message if the number entered is between 15 and 25 or between 45 and 50.
```
```
7 - Make an algorithm that receives a number and shows a message if this number is greater than 80, less than 25 or equal to 40.
```
```
8 - Increment the previous exercise, in case the measures form a valid triangle, inform which type of triangle they form: equilateral, isosceles or scalene.
```
```
9 - Remake the previous exercise now showing right triangle.
```
```
10 - Make an algorithm that draws a number from one to ten and gives the user two chances to hit it.
```
```
11 - Update the previous algorithm now making it possible to inform if the number is greater or less than the attempt.
```
```
12 - Update the previous algorithm now with 3 attempts.
```
```
13 - Draw two numbers from 1 to 5 and ask the user to hit the two numbers,not in the same order.
```
```
14 - Draw two numbers from 1 to 10 and inform how many of these numbers are between 3 and 7.
```
```
15 - Zeca will use a computer to control the daily income of his work as fisherman.
Each time he brings a fish weight greater than that established by the fishing regulation (50kg) he must
pay a fine of $4.00 for each kilogram. Zeca needs an algorithm to help him calculating if there is any 
excess and how much is this excess.
```
```
16 - Write a program that displays any complete multiplication tables. The program should ask the user which multiplication table he wants to view, which he will answer by typing a number from 1 to 10.
```
```
17 - Write a program that displays the square of all numbers from 1 to 20.
```
```
18 - Write a program that asks the user for 5 numbers, and for each number entered, informs if it is pair or inpair.
```
```
19 - Write a program that displays the sum of the numbers from 1 to 100.
```
```
20 - Write a program that asks for 10 numbers and at the end displays the sum of all of them.
```
```
21 - Write a program that prompts the user for a number, and then displays all of its divisors.
```
```
22 - Ask the user to enter a number between 10 and 20. If an invalid number is entered, ask again until the user enters a correct number.
```
```
23 - Write a program that asks for the code and the height of 5 athletes. At the end of the data entry, propt the height and code of the tallest athlete.
```
```
24 - Request a number and prompt if it is a perfect number.
